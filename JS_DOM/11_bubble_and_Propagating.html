     <!--  Event Propagation
Event propagation is the mechanism that defines how events travel through the DOM tree. It has three phases:
#Capturing Phase
- The event starts at the root (document) and travels downward through ancestor elements until it reaches the target element.
- If you set {capture: true} in addEventListener, the handler runs during this phase.
#Target Phase
- The event reaches the actual element that triggered it (the target).
- Event listeners on the target element run here.
Bubbling Phase
- After reaching the target, the event travels upward through ancestor elements back to the root.
- This is the default phase where most event listeners execute unless capturing is explicitly set.

🔹 Event Bubbling
Event bubbling is the default behavior of event propagation in JavaScript:
- When an event occurs on a child element, it first runs the handler on that element.
- Then, the event "bubbles up" to its parent, grandparent, and so on, until it reaches the root (document).
- Example: Clicking a <button> inside a <div> will trigger both the button’s and the div’s click handlers (unless stopped).

🔹 Controlling Propagation
- event.stopPropagation() → Stops the event from continuing to bubble or capture further.
- event.stopImmediatePropagation() → Stops bubbling and prevents other listeners on the same element from firing.
- event.preventDefault() → Prevents the default browser action (e.g., stopping a form submission), but does not stop propagation.
