<!-- ## Event Delegation

Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a **parent element** instead of multiple child elements.

It works because of **event bubbling**.

### Example

```js
document.getElementById("list").addEventListener("click", function(e) {
  if (e.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log("Item clicked:", e.target.textContent);
  }
});
Instead of adding a click listener to every `<li>`, you add one to the parent.

## What is Event Bubbling
When an event occurs on an element, it first runs on the target, then propagates upward through its ancestors.
Flow:
`child → parent → body → document`


## Benefits of Event Bubbling (Why Delegation Works)

Less memory usage
You don’t attach many listeners.

Better performance
Fewer listeners = faster execution.

Handles dynamic elements
Newly added child elements automatically work without adding new listeners.

Cleaner code
Centralized event handling.

Core idea:

Event delegation relies on bubbling to capture child events at the parent level.
